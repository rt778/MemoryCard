Installation

1) Unzip the file in your favorite folder.
2) With your favorite browser open the file named MemoryCard.html
3) You are ready to play the game!


Composition

The program is composed of the following files:

- MemoryCard.html : this is the main file that must be opened in the browser in order to launch the game, it contains mainly the HTML element of the game and of the leaderboard.

- MemoryCard.css : the styling.

- MemoryCard.js : contains the game logic in javascript.

- Timer.js : contains the timer's logic in javascript.

- scoreBoard.js : contains the leaderboard's elements in javascript.

-  The folder "graphics" contains the graphics of the game, basically a gif in order to display the back of the cards.


Gameplay

Click on "Deal the cards" button, the cards should now show inside the green area.

Click on the cards to match them!

Once the game is completed, a pop up message will ask for the player's name; enter the name and click "ok".

The leaderboard should then pop up to congratulate the player and recap the score.

The button "play again" or "cancel" takes the player back to the game screen.

The button "Restart" resets the game to the start.

Have Fun!


Note:

Line 83 of "MemoryCard.js": "deckOfCards = shuffle(deckOfCards);" can be commented out for testing purpose, in that case the cards are not shuffled and it makes the game a lot easier ;-)
